# Dictionaries

As you might have guessed, we love lists. However, list items are accessed in order by index number.  This isn't always the way we want it to work.

Dictionaries are a slightly different type of list that access data by giving each item a **key**.  This creates what we call **key:value** pairs.

Now we can access each item through its key, instead of having to remember what index it is at in the list.

## Creating a dictionary - brace! 

Curly, curly braces...

To create a dictionary we start just like a list, except with curly braces `{}`. This dictionary will store data about a user.

The data is inserted in key value pairs like this. Each pair is separated by a comma:

ðŸ‘‰ The first key:value pair below has "name" as the key and "David" as the value. Try it out:

```python
myUser = {"name": "David", "age": 128}
```


## Printing the keys

To output (print) from a dictionary, we can use the **key** instead of the index. Note that we **still use square brackets** for accessing items (ex: `["name"]`).

ðŸ‘‰ Let's `print` "name".

```python
myUser = {"name": "David", "age": 128}

print(myUser["name"])

# This code outputs 'David'.
```

## Changing an item
You can use the `=` syntax to change key values.

ðŸ‘‰ Let's change 'David' to 'The legendary David'
```python
myUser = {"name": "David", "age": 128}

myUser["name"] = "The legendary David"
print(myUser)

# This code outputs 'name:'the legendary David', 'age':'128.
```
