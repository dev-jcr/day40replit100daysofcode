## Printing with keys and fStrings
ðŸ‘‰ Let's `run` this code and see what happens:

```python
myUser = {"name": "David", "age": 128}

print(f"Your name is {myUser["name"]} and your age is {myUser["age"]}")
```

  - Note that we have to put the keys in **single quotation marks** `''` inside the fString when using this technique.

- This is because we've already used double quotes to start and end the fString. So, using `""` for the dictionary value would get Python all confuzzled.

```python
myUser = {"name": "David", "age": 128}

print(f"Your name is {myUser['name']} and your age is {myUser['age']}")

# This code outputs 'Your name is David and your age is 128'.
```

## Syntax error?

ðŸ‘‰ Why are you getting a syntax error on the print statement line?


```python
myUser = {"name": "David", "age": 128}

print(myUser{"name"})
```

<details> <summary> ðŸ‘€ Answer </summary>

- The `print` statement uses **square** brackets. Curly braces `{}` are only used to call the value.

```python
myUser = {"name": "David", "age": 128}

print(myUser["name"])
```

## Undefined?

ðŸ‘‰ What is the problem here?
```python
myUser = {name: "David", "age": 128}

print(myUser["name"])
```

<details> <summary> ðŸ‘€ Answer </summary>

The key, _name_, in the dictionary should be inside quotes.

```python
myUser = {"name": "David", "age": 128}

print(myUser["name"])
```

## Spare Key?

ðŸ‘‰ What is the problem here?
```python
myUser = {name:"David", "age": 128, "age" = 129}

print(myUser)
```

<details> <summary> ðŸ‘€ Answer </summary>

A dictionary can't have two keys with the same name. It always overrides the previous one. Therefore, the 129 overrides the age, 128.

```python
myUser = {name:"David", "age": 128}

myUser["age"] = 129

print(myUser)
```
