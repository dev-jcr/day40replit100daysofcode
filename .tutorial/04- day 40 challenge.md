# 👉 Day 40 Challenge

Today's challenge is to create a contact card using a dictionary.

1. Ask the user to input their name, date of birth, telephone number, email and physical address.
2. Store it all in a dictionary.
3. Print it out in a nice way once its stored.

Example:

```
🌟Contact Card🌟

Input your name > David Morgan

Input your date of birth > 01/01/1900

Input your telephone number > 01234 567890

Input your email > david@replit.com

Input your address > The Cupboard Under The Stairs, Replit Towers, NY.

Hi David Morgan. Our dictionary says that you were born on 01/01/1900, we can call you on 01234 567890, email david@replit.com, or write to The Cupboard Under The Stairs, Replit Towers, NY.

- You may find `"""` helpful here.
- Don't forget to `.strip()` out any unwanted spaces.
- Pay close attention to when to use `[]` and when to use `{}`.
- For extra fun, try [investigating the `.update()` method](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries_add.asp) for another way of working with dictionaries.
